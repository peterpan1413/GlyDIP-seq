# Gene Body Profile of Gly/OxiDIP-seq Peaks using ChIPseeker

This R script demonstrates how to visualize peak enrichment profiles of Gly/OxiDIP-seq data over gene bodies using **ChIPseeker** and **TxDb** annotations for human (hg19).

---

## Requirements

R packages:
- `ChIPseeker`
- `GenomicRanges`
- `TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene`

---

## Script

```r
# Load required libraries
library(GenomicRanges)
library(ChIPseeker)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)

# Load TxDb annotation object
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene

# Load peak file
peak <- readPeakFile(
  "AGI04_11_S11_L003_clean_pe.MDBG.bam_peaks.txt",
  header = FALSE,
  sep = "\t"
)

# Output as PDF
pdf("OxiDIP_IgG_TSS_signal_intensity.pdf", width = 6, height = 5)

# Plot gene body profile (TSS Â± 20% gene length)
plotPeakProf2(
  peak = peak,
  upstream = rel(0.2),
  downstream = rel(0.2),
  conf = 0.95,
  by = "gene",
  type = "body",
  nbin = 500,
  TxDb = txdb,
  weightCol = "V7",        # Column V7 = signalValue (MACS3 score)
  ignore_strand = FALSE    # Keep strand specificity
)

# Close PDF output
dev.off()
```

---

## Notes

- This script plots the average distribution of peak intensities across gene bodies, centered on TSS and TES.
- The `weightCol = "V7"` argument uses MACS3's signal value column as weighting for peak strength.
- Ensure the column structure of your peak file matches the `V7` indexing (e.g., 7th column = signalValue).

---

## Output

The resulting PDF shows **signal enrichment profiles across gene bodies** for the provided OxiDIP-seq peaks.
