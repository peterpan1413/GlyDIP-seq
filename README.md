DNA glycation, a non-enzymatic modification triggered by reactive metabolites such as methylglyoxal (MG), has been implicated in various metabolic and neurological disorders. However, its genome-wide distribution and biological consequences in the developing brain remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed a novel method, GlyDIP-seq, which enables high-resolution profiling of glycation-derived DNA lesions (specifically NÂ²-carboxyethyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, CEdG) across the genome.
Integrative analysis revealed that genes with increased GlyDIP signals upon MG treatment were significantly enriched in developmental and autism-associated pathways. Interestingly, genes commonly targeted by both GlyDIP- and OxiDIP-seq were longer, developmentally regulated, and often peaked in expression prior to the late gestational window of elevated autism risk, implying a potential mechanistic link between prenatal metabolic stress and neurodevelopmental disorders.
Altogether, our findings establish GlyDIP-seq as a powerful tool for studying DNA glycation and uncover a previously unrecognized layer of epigenome vulnerability during brain development, particularly under diabetic or oxidative stress conditions.
